As we discussed in the Report.txt, there are mainly two parts of our design, ml and website, and here are the steps needed to run them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the Website part:
As I detail described steps to run the website locally in report.txt: 
-Steps to run the website locally: 
You need to first install node.js and npm(node package manager). Then check if the dependencies meet the requirements of package.json file, usually, they are all included. And I upload all the dependencies installed with node and npm, which included all the needed dependencies(in the node_modules folder), so as long as node and npm are installed, it should be good to go.
Then create databases named p2 and create tables(vehicles, model, manufacturer) using the CSV data Dataset_vehicles.csv, Dataset_model.csv, Dataset_manufacturer.csv. Donâ€™t forget to change the MySQL connection information in the connection.js file. 
Then in the terminal, cd to folder P2, type command: npm run dev, this command runs the scripts in package.json file. Then the server should be running locally if the port 8000 is not in use by other applications. 
Finally, in the browser, go to localhost:8000/home
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the ML part:
Either Open and run ML_part.ipynb or run python3 ML_part.py to generate two csv files containing a table for manufacturer and its stringindexer manufacturer_VEC; a table for model and its stringindexer model_VEC; also the coefficients and intercept for linear regression model.
These two tables will be used as a lookup table for the website part calculation.
